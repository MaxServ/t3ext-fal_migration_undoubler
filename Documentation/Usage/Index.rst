Usage
=====

Ensure the _cli_lowlevel user has the proper permissions
========================================================

The user running the command-line task must have persmissions to remove files from the `_migrated` folder. You will need to edit the `_cli_lowlevel` user in the backend and grant him/her access to a filemount containing the `_migrated` folder. If you don't do this, the files can not be deleted and the migration will exit.
